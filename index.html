	Hi, I'm Adedeji Adetola.<br/> I'm also known as sphinX 
	<p>I'm a student of the University of Lagos, currently studying Biomedical engineering and also running a front end development programme in Ecx. <br/>I love solving the rubik's cube, reading and also anything tech, bio-tech related.<br/>I love hacking too. I'm a little introverted i.e I'm not social though(i wish i was... Lol).
	<p>On a lighter mood, I watch anime, series et al.</p>
<pre>
Shout out to the facilitators of Ecx, y'all are doing well.
I also hope to learn a lot more from you guys and prolly be of help in any way possible.
Thank you.

This is a little description of me. I hope you got to know me at the least way possible.<br/> No pictures since I don't take pictures regularly.
